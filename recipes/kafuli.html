    <h1>How to make kafuli</h1>
    <p>
        Step 1 <br>
To start with, wash palak (spinach) and methi (fenugreek leaves) in running water and chop them on a chopping board. Take a pan, keep it on medium flame and boil a little water in it. In that boiling water, add methi and palak along with chopped green chilies. <br>
<br>
Step 2 <br>
Remove it from flame and blend the mixture in a blender. Keep this paste aside and chop ginger and garlic. In a pan, heat oil on a medium flame and add garlic-ginger in the pan and saut√© them properly. Then, add cumin seeds and asafoetida. Mix well. <br>
<br>
Step 3 <br>
Then add mashed paste, turmeric powder, dry coriander powder, salt and enough water to the pan. Let the mixture boil. Finally dissolve rice powder in water and add it in the mixture. Cover the pan and let the curry cook for 15 minutes over low flame. Remove from flame once done and serve hot.
